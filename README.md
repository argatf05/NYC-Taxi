# NYC-Taxi
# **Background (Latar Belakang)**
Congestion surcharges for taxis in the Manhattan borough were implemented back in 2019 (https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/for-hire-congestion-pricing/). This has sparked debate among the government and taxi users.

Effective congestion pricing is crucial for the long-term sustainability of urban transportation systems. The congestion surcharges aim to reduce carbon emissions, traffic, and encourage the use of public transportation.

However, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance claims that the surcharges will severely impact drivers and medallion owners. On the other hand, ride-share apps such as Uber and Lyft claim to support the initiative. They said it enables fairer practices since taxi users also contribute to the congestion occurring in Manhattan. This initiative has also received some support from taxi passengers, who have alternative transportation modes such as the subway.

Therefore, is the implementation of the congestion surcharge already fair and beneficial?
